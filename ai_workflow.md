Workflow: 
1. UNDERSTAND & VALIDATE
2. TRACK progress 
3. PLAN with confidence  
4. USE TDD to cover business logic. Do not create obvious, useless tests.
5. EXECUTE with minimal code (every line of code is a liability)
6. VERIFY BEHAVIOR with tests
7. REPEAT 1-6 UNTIL YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE VALUE TO THE END USER
8. AT THE END OF EACH FEATURE, AUDIT INTEGRATION TEST COVERAGE
9. AT THE END OF EACH PHASE, REORIENT AND PLAN FOR REFACTORING
