Final Development Plan: Stamp Python Port for Inkscape
1. Project Scope & Goals
Goal: Faithfully port the Stamp and Sequence generative art system from TypeScript to Python, making it usable as a modern, scriptable Inkscape extension.
Core Deliverables: Python modules for Stamp and Sequence, Inkscape extension integration, example scripts, and documentation.
Stretch Goal: Include hatching functionality for advanced shading and texture.
2. Core Components
A. Stamp Class (Python)
Implements a fluent, chainable API for building generative shapes.
Public methods include:
Shape primitives: circle, ellipse, rectangle, rounded_rectangle, polygon, leaf_shape, trapezoid, arch, bone, tangram, rounded_tangram, stamp
Transformations: move_to, move, forward, rotate, rotate_to, align, crop, repeat_last, step_back
Boolean ops: add, subtract, intersect, boolean
Bounds & style: set_bounds, mark_bounds_start, mark_bounds_end, default_style, style
Utility: bake, get_nodes, set_nodes, to_string, from_string, clone, copy, bounding_box, bounding_circle, reset
Internal node/command system for shape construction.
Serialization and deserialization for saving/loading shapes.
B. Sequence Class (Python)
Provides parameter streams for generative variation, supporting all picker modes and expression-based construction.
Handles global/static management and integration with Stamp parameters.
C. Geometry & Boolean Operations
Port only the necessary geometry classes (Point, Ray, Polygon, BoundingBox, etc.) unless Inkscape’s Python API provides equivalents.
For boolean operations (union, subtract, intersect), prefer Inkscape’s built-in helpers (via inkex or SVG DOM) if available; otherwise, use a Python library such as pyclipper.
Abstract all geometry and boolean ops for easy swapping between custom, third-party, or Inkscape-native implementations.
3. Inkscape Extension Integration
Wrap Stamp and Sequence logic in an Inkscape extension using Python (inkex).
Allow users to configure generative parameters via the extension UI or script.
Output SVG elements that are fully compatible with Inkscape.
Expose only the intended public API to users.
4. Example Scripts & Documentation
Port representative example scripts from the TypeScript codebase to Python.
Provide clear API documentation, usage guides, and a README for installation and usage.
Include example Inkscape extension workflows and parameter explanations.
5. Stretch Goal: Hatching Functionality
Port the hatching algorithms from hatch.ts for generating parallel/crosshatched lines within shapes.
Integrate hatching as a method or option within Stamp or as a utility.
Prefer Inkscape-native pattern/hatch fills if available; otherwise, use custom Python logic.
Document hatching usage and options.
6. Development Process
Analyze and port core geometry and Sequence modules.
Port the Stamp class, ensuring all public methods and the node/command system are implemented.
Abstract geometry/boolean operations, using Inkscape helpers where possible.
Integrate with Inkscape as an extension, exposing the core API and example workflows.
Port and validate example scripts.
(Stretch) Add hatching functionality and document its use.
Test, document, and iterate based on results and feedback.
7. Key Considerations
Maintain a clean, Pythonic, and user-friendly API.
Prioritize compatibility and integration with Inkscape’s extension system and SVG output.
Modularize and document thoroughly for future extension and adaptation.
If you have any further priorities or constraints, please let me know. Otherwise, this plan is ready for execution!
