# Session 1: Initial Analysis

## Current State Assessment

### What Works Well
- **Stamp API**: Fluent interface is excellent for generative art
- **Expression System**: Powerful string-based expressions like `"BH / 2 + WH / 2"`
- **Sequence System**: Dynamic parameter generation with statements
- **FlowBuilder Proof**: Demonstrated live coding concepts work

### Current Pain Points
- **Slow Iteration**: IDE ↔ Browser switching kills creative flow
- **No Visual Debugging**: Can't click shapes to see source code
- **No Interactive Controls**: Can't tweak values without code changes
- **Performance Issues**: Complex expressions recompute every time

### Key User Stories
1. **Artist**: "I want to see my generative art update as I type"
2. **Debugger**: "I want to click a shape and see what code generated it"
3. **Explorer**: "I want sliders to experiment with sequence parameters"
4. **Developer**: "I want autocomplete and error highlighting"

## Technical Findings

### Stamp Core (1,771 lines)
- Single responsibility violation - does everything
- Heavy use of `any` via `$` function
- Console.log bug on line 169
- No expression compilation/caching
- Silent error failures

### Sequence System (626 lines)
- Uses `eval()` for flexibility (security concern)
- Powerful but opaque parameter generation
- No caching of computed sequences

### Integration Issues
- Dual parameter resolution systems
- Type safety breaks at module boundaries  
- No unified error handling

## FlowBuilder Lessons Learned

### What Worked
- Real-time syntax highlighting
- Bidirectional code ↔ visual conversion
- Context-aware autocomplete
- Live error detection

### What Needs Improvement
- Code quality (admitted by user)
- Architecture clarity
- Performance optimization
- Better separation of concerns

## Next Steps
1. **Architecture Planning**: Design clean system inspired by FlowBuilder
2. **Component Design**: Monaco editor integration, live rendering, interaction
3. **Incremental Implementation**: Start with minimal viable editor
4. **Performance Strategy**: Expression compilation, smart caching
