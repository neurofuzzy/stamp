# Prototyping Area

This folder contains experimental components for the **Stamp Live Coding Environment** project.

## Purpose

Each subfolder represents an **isolated exploration** of a specific component or feature, allowing us to:

- **Rapid experimentation** without affecting the main codebase
- **Component isolation** for focused development and testing
- **Proof-of-concept validation** before integration
- **Architecture exploration** for complex features

## Structure

Each component folder should be **self-contained** with its own:
- `README.md` explaining the component's purpose and findings
- Dependencies and build setup (if needed)
- Example code and demonstrations
- Documentation of lessons learned

## Component Areas

Based on our planning sessions, potential components include:

### **Core Interface Components**
- `2d-workspace-navigation/` - Horizontal/vertical panel system
- `sequence-visualization/` - Icon-based sequence state display
- `toy-interface-elements/` - Playful UI component library

### **Technical Components**  
- `stamp-execution-tracer/` - Step-through debugging system
- `sequence-resolver/` - Live sequence state management
- `auto-scaling-export/` - Smart sizing and centering

### **Integration Components**
- `code-canvas-bridge/` - Real-time code â†” visual sync
- `shape-inspector/` - Click-to-source debugging
- `production-export/` - Manufacturing-ready output

## Development Approach

1. **Start Simple**: Minimal viable implementation
2. **Isolate Concerns**: Each component tests one concept  
3. **Document Findings**: What worked, what didn't, lessons learned
4. **Integrate Gradually**: Successful components move to main project

*This prototyping area supports our core principle of **progressive enhancement** - start simple, add features incrementally, and validate concepts before committing to implementation.*
